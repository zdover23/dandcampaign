\section{Background}

Space Moose is aware of Boccob, the God of Magic, but has been more interested in revering Freddie Mercury since he heard \textit{Queen II}.

\section{The Events of August 17, 2014}
Space Moose finds himself aboard \textit{The Filthy Whore}, a ship traveling across an aquamarine saltwater sea, from Rektcliffe to Rocksfall, under the command of Captain Keating. \textit{The Filthy Whore} is on a course that Captain Keating calls ``Smuggler's Run''.

Space Moose, a human wizard, is quartered in a cabin in the starboard bow of the deck one level below the weather deck. He leaves this cabin and knocks on the door of the cabin to port. Ping answers the door, and Space Moose asks if Ping would like to find some alcohol and get drunk. Ping says that he doesn't drink, but he will come with Space Moose to find something to eat or something non-alcoholic to drink. Space Moose and Ping walk up the stairs to the weather deck, to find Douglas, a human bard, and Persis, a halfling, standing in the stern. Douglas is vomiting over the starboard bulwark. Soon, Muckroot and Blarg (a barbarian) join the party. Muckroot has a companion, Gummy, a crocodile. Persis has a companion, Barnabas, a raven. The party talks among itself and decides to explore ship, hunting for chickens for Gummy and alcohol for everyone\footnote{except Ping}.

The group explores the ship, and encounters a stout woman with a meat cleaver, a cook,  who tells them that there are no chickens in the room she's in and that they should find the pantry elsewhere. The party continues to explore the ship and ultimately enters a level below the level below the weather deck. It is almost completely dark. Only the raven and the crocodile and the gnomish druid can see anything.  This level of the ship is packed full of crates, with minimal room between them serving as thoroughfares. Near the stern of the ship, the party hears incomprehensible talk from behind the crates. The talk remains incomprehensible even to the wizard Space Moose, who has knowledge of languages, and to the gnomish druid, who knows, like, five languages. 

In the darkness near the stern of the ship, the party engages with an unknown party that strikes Muckroot's crocodile Gummy in the nose with a longsword. The blow is weak and does not kill Gummy. Persis remembers that she has an oil lamp, lights it, and the party is able to see in the cargo hold. The floor is revealed to be covered in pitch, to fight leaks. The aggressors look like lizard people: "Parasaurians," says Muckroot the gnomish druid.

Blarg the Barbarian intimidates the lizards, and Space Moose hits one of the lizard people with a quarterstaff. Persis hits the lizard person with Magic Missile for 5 damage. Ping inexplicably runs past a still-standing lizard-person without striking it at all. Blarg the Barbarian loses patience, charges to the fore, and swings a greatsword, narrowly missing Ping, who masterfully dodges. Space Moose is not so dextrous, and is hit in the belly with Blarg's greatsword after it passes through the lizard person. Space Moose is hit for -12, giving him -7HP. Space Moose falls into unconsciousness. 

The Captain and several crewmembers arrive, brandishing weapons. Douglas asks the Captain why militant lizard people were on the ship. Captain Keating and the crew take Space Moose upstairs. Blarg cuts off the leg of a lizard person to feed to Gummy the crocodile.

The party (minus Space Moose, who is mostly dead upstairs) finds two doors in the stern of the cargo hold. Blarg kicks through one of the doors, leaving a hole the size of a barbarian's foot in it.
On the other side of the door, Blarg can feel a metal bar under his foot. Blarg has found the ship's brig. Douglas the bard asks Blarg the barbarian what's inside the brig. Douglas looks inside and sees a shadowy figure. Douglas hears muttering from inside the brig. ``Hi there,'' Douglas says. ``You don't have any lizardy friends, do you?''

Meanwhile, Space Moose awakens in a room where the cook from earlier and a man are standing over him.

Back in the cargo hold, four more lizard people appear, amidships, apparently from nowhere. I mean that no one saw them show up. Everyone's back must have been turned or something.

Upstairs, the cook is pouring rancid salsa into Space Moose's mouth, which restores him to +4 health\footnote{This is a pretty good sentence.}. Space Moose sits up and leaves the room. Space Moose finds the Captain and offers to help in whatever way he can. When Space Moose finds the Captain, the Captain is in the cabin of a murdered man. The Captain asks Space Moose first if he can bring the dead man back to life (Space Moose can't), and then to fetch his friends. Space Moose says that he will not return alone to the cargo hold because he has HP4 and he is not stupid and he does not want to be killed. The Captain tells Space Moose to ask Morkin, the pilot of the ship, to get Maggie and Raynard to accompany him to the cargo hold. Space Moose sets off in search of Morkin the ship's pilot.

Back in the cargo hold, the crocodile Gummy snaps vainly at nothing\footnote{Good try, Gummy.}. Blarg tricks one of the parasaurians into cutting off the head of another parasaurian with what, in another context, might be called ``sweet dance moves''.

Upstairs, Space Moose finds Morkin piloting the ship. Space Moose describes the situation as comprehensibly as he can, and Morkin dispatches Raynard and Maggie to help. Maggie has two daggers, and Raynard has a spear\footnote{Raynard is totally taking a spear into close-quarters combat. Genius.}. Space Moose leads Maggie and Raynard to the cargo hold. Space Moose, Maggie, and Raynard are in the bow of the ship, and the rest of the party are visible to them in the stern, in the glow of the halfling's hooded lantern (and also, apparently, the gnomish druid did something that Annika described as "that lighting thing", which we'll document more completely later when we ask Laura what it was she did, if she even remembers by then, which she may not). The point is that the party is kind of split up: some of them are in the bow of the cargo hold, but most of them are in the stern of the cargo hold.

Ping punches the lizard people.

Persis gets well out of the range of the attacks of the lizard people and casts Magic Missile for 4 damage against a lizard person. This shears off the face of the lizard person, who sits down on the pitch hull and dies.

Douglas hits a lizard person for 1 damage. Douglas's lunge was executed a moment too soon, and it was executed with a shortsword, which is why the damage is so paltry. Also, Douglas is nauseated and may vomit at any moment. Also, the ship is moving the way a ship moves in water, which isn't helping Douglas not to vomit.

Space Moose asks Raynard and Maggie to fight the parasaurians\footnote{This is a pretty good sentence, too.}. Maggie charges forward and slaps a parasaurian. It dies, but it may not have died from the slap. It might have been dying anyway. But Maggie at least makes her allegiance known by the slap. She is not fighting for the parasaurians.

Muckroot summons Nature's Ally, a venomous viper, inside the brig\footnote{There was a brief discussion about the distinction between the words ``poisonous'' and ``venomous'', and it was agreed that the viper was venomous and not poisonous. Good discussion.``Who knows?'' Annika says. ``Maybe viper meat is also poisonous.'' This is a question that will be solved by future generations who are equipped with more complete biological science. (We couldn't find the answer within 40 seconds of Googling, so we gave up.)}. The magic-sensitive members of the party sense a failed spell, like a missed golf-ball (``whiff''), from within the brig. Clearly the muttering shadowy figure has failed to dispel Nature's Ally.

Persis casts Magic Missile into the brig.

Douglas fails to hit the shadowy figure in the brig.

The gnome does nothing effective.

Blarg hits a crate.

Ping fails to hit anything.

Persis listens at the door and hears nothing.

The viper shoots fire and sets the hull of the ship on fire.

Space Moose sends Maggie to stab the parasaurian to death. Maggie climbs on top of the parasaurian and stabs it with both of her daggers, killing it.

Everything in the cargo hold is on fire. The party runs upstairs. The party reports the fire to the Captain. The Captain, trailed by some of his crew, goes downstairs.

The Captain returns upstairs, and enters into a quasi-legal dispute with Space Moose and Douglas about the etiology of the fire and the contents of the brig. The Captain does not believe that there was anything in the brig at the time, and raises the possibility that someone in the party conjured the fish people. 

Space Moose and Blarg learn that a figure under the sheet was not the shadowy figure in the brig but the primary passenger on the ship, the man in whose cabin Space Moose earlier found the Captain.

As thinkers dither, Blarg gets bored.

Blarg turns to watch the sunset over the bulwarks, and Space Moose accompanies him.
